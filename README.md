# Steam Deck Theme
This is a personal project of mine where I homebrewed my steam deck to code in the menu screen using CSS. From changing the icons of the button layout, and even changing the shape and disabling the blur effect, it took a ton of work and it looked amazing! I personally designed and tweaked this to my liking so I can have a unique and fun experience with the OS. I've also added my own animation boot up screen and added music. I've also designed the sound effects of my own as well!
